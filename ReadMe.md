This is a Python script to search a WINDOWS EDITION ark ini file for duplicated Lines.
Before it will run you need to complete 4 easy steps.

**If  The Following Is NOT already Done**
1) Create a folder named files in the same folder that this script is in
2) Copy and Paste your ini files into the new files-folder
3) Create a folder named 'output' inside the files-folder
4) Add the name of each file that you wish to validate(include the .ini extension)
to the file_names list below this section
in the same format as the two file names it already includes
(You must remove the current filenames if they are not being checked)
